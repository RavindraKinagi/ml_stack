compare the performance of different models on a personality dataset. You're using various libraries such as lazypredict, fastai, and xgboost. You're also preprocessing the data by detecting continuous and categorical variables, normalizing and imputing missing data.
To compare the performance of the models, you're using lazypredict's LazyRegressor and LazyClassifier. The LazyRegressor is used for regression tasks, while the LazyClassifier is used for classification tasks. These libraries provide a streamlined way to evaluate multiple models without explicitly specifying each model.
You're also using Bayesian Optimization to optimize the hyperparameters of the models. This can help find the best set of hyperparameters for each model, improving their performance.
For the FastAI library, you're using a TabNet model, which is a deep learning model specifically designed for tabular data. You're saving the best performing FastAI model based on early stopping.
You're also generating plots and CSV files for XGBoost feature importances, which can help understand the importance of each feature in the models.
