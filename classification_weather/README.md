The provided code performs the following steps for weather data analysis:
1.	Loads the weather data from a CSV file.
2.	Removes unnecessary columns ('Unnamed: 0', 'Date') and separates the target variable ('RainTomorrow').
3.	Converts the target variable to binary values (0 for 'No' and 1 for 'Yes').
4.	Splits the data into training and testing sets using Stratified Shuffle Split, which ensures balanced representation of classes in both sets.
5.	Separates the features into categorical and numerical features.
6.	Creates a data pipeline with a numerical pipeline that handles missing values (imputation with median) and performs standard scaling, and a categorical pipeline that applies one-hot encoding.
7.	Applies the data pipeline to the training and testing features.
8.	Defines a Classifier class with methods for logistic regression, decision tree classification, and random forest classification.
9.	Initializes an instance of the Classifier class with processed training features, target labels, processed testing features, and target labels.
10.	Calls the random_forest() method of the Classifier class to train a random forest classifier, predict the labels for the testing features, and evaluate the model's score.
classification problem where the goal is to predict whether it will rain tomorrow or not. The code trains and evaluates different classification models to solve this problem.
