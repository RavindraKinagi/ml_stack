A simple yet challenging project, to estimate the BMI based on the Gender, Height & Weight. The complexity arises due the fact that dataset has less samples, & is highly imbalanced. Can you overcome these obstacles & build a good predictive model to classify them?

This data frame contains the following columns:

Gender : Male / Female

Height : Number (cm)

Weight : Number (Kg)

Index : 0 - Extremely Weak, 1 - Weak, 2 - Normal, 3 - Overweight, 4 - Obesity, 5 - Extreme Obesity

### **Acknowledgements:**

This dataset has been referred from Kaggle.

### **Objective:**

Understand the Dataset & cleanup (if required).
Build classification models to predict various categories of BMI.
Also fine-tune the hyperparameters & compare the evaluation metrics of various classification algorithms.
