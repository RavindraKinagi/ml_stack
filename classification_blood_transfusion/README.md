The problem statement for the given code can be stated as follows:
The objective of this code is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a blood transfusion dataset. The code accomplishes the following tasks:
1.	Load the dataset from a CSV file and store it in a Pandas DataFrame.
2.	Display the first few rows of the DataFrame using the head() function to get a glimpse of the data.
3.	Generate histograms for the 'Recency (months)' and 'Frequency (times)' columns to visualize the distribution of these numerical variables.
4.	Obtain the count of unique values in the 'whether he/she donated blood in March 2007' column using the value_counts() function.
5.	Print information about the DataFrame, including data types, column names, and shape using the info() method, columns attribute, and shape attribute, respectively.
6.	Check for missing values in the DataFrame using the isnull().sum() function.
7.	Determine the number of unique values in each column using the nunique() method.
8.	Print the unique values of specific columns ('Frequency (times)', 'Time (months)', 'Recency (months)') using the unique() function.
9.	Calculate the sum, median, mean, minimum, and maximum values for each column using the sum(), median(), mean(), min(), and max() methods, respectively.
10.	Remove duplicate rows from the DataFrame using the drop_duplicates() function.
11.	Compute the standard deviation and variance for each column using the std() and var() methods, respectively.
The purpose of this code is to gain insights into the blood transfusion dataset by analyzing the distribution of variables, identifying unique values, and computing summary statistics. The code helps in understanding the data's characteristics and can guide further analysis or modeling tasks.
