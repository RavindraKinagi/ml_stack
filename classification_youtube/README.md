The provided code performs the following steps:
1.	Imports the necessary libraries and functions.
2.	Reads the YouTube videos dataset from a CSV file.
3.	Displays the first few rows of the dataset and the description of the first video.
4.	Checks the shape of the dataset and the count of null values.
5.	Analyzes the distribution of video categories using a pie chart.
6.	Defines a function to generate a word cloud for a specific category.
7.	Generates word clouds for different categories ('food', 'travel', 'history', 'art_music') by extracting the descriptions from the dataset.
8.	Performs data processing steps:
•	Removes punctuation from the descriptions.
•	Tokenizes the words in the descriptions.
•	Removes stopwords from the tokenized words.
•	Converts the text sequences to numerical sequences using the Keras Tokenizer.
9.	Builds the model:
•	Sets the input shape based on the average sequence length.
•	Creates an Embedding layer, a GRU layer, and a Dense layer with softmax activation.
10.	Compiles the model with sparse categorical cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer.
11.	Trains the model on the training data and validates on a validation set.
12.	Plots the training and validation loss and accuracy over epochs.
13.	Evaluates the model on the test data and prints the loss and accuracy.
14.	Calculates and prints the classification report and confusion matrix.
15.	Defines a function to plot the confusion matrix.
16.	Plots the confusion matrix and the normalized confusion matrix.
text classification problem where the goal is to classify YouTube videos into different categories based on their descriptions. The code preprocesses the text data, builds a recurrent neural network (RNN) model using the Keras framework, trains the model, and evaluates its performance using accuracy and the confusion matrix.
