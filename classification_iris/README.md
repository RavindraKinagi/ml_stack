The problem statement for this project is to predict the species of Iris flowers based on their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset consists of 150 observations, each with 4 features, and the target variable is the species of the Iris flower (setosa, versicolor, virginica).
The project involves the following steps:
1.	Data exploration and visualization: The dataset is analyzed to understand its structure and explore the relationships between different features. Pair plots and violin plots are used to visualize the distribution and relationships of the features with respect to different species of Iris flowers.
2.	Modeling with scikit-learn: The dataset is divided into the feature matrix (X) and the target variable (y). The K-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier and logistic regression models are used for classification. Initially, the models are trained and tested on the same dataset, and accuracy scores are calculated.
3.	Splitting the dataset: The dataset is split into a training set and a testing set using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn. This allows for evaluating the models on unseen data and avoiding overfitting.
4.	Model evaluation: The KNN classifier and logistic regression models are trained and tested on the training and testing sets, respectively. Accuracy scores are calculated to assess the performance of the models.
5.	Choosing the KNN model: Based on the accuracy scores, a value of k=12 is chosen as the number of neighbors for the KNN model. The KNN model is then trained on the entire dataset.
6.	Prediction: The trained KNN model is used to make predictions on new, unseen observations. An example prediction is shown using the values [6, 3, 4, 2] for sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
The goal of this project is to accurately classify the species of Iris flowers based on their features using machine learning algorithms.
