Based on the given customer behavior dataset, the problem statement could be to predict whether a customer will make a purchase or not based on their gender and estimated salary.
The dataset contains information about customers, including their gender and estimated salary, as well as whether they made a purchase or not.
The goal is to build a classification model that can predict the likelihood of a customer making a purchase. This is a binary classification problem, where the target variable is the "Purchased" column.
The first steps involve data preprocessing and exploration. This includes checking the shape and size of the dataset, examining descriptive statistics, visualizing distributions and relationships between variables using plots such as histograms, scatterplots, and heatmaps.
In order to use the gender variable in the classification model, it needs to be encoded into numerical values. The LabelEncoder from scikit-learn can be used to achieve this.
Next, the dataset can be split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn. This will allow us to train the classification models on the training set and evaluate their performance on the testing set.
Three classification models can be trained and evaluated: Random Forest Classifier, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree Classifier. These models can be imported from scikit-learn and instantiated.
The training data can be used to fit (train) each model, and then the trained models can be used to predict the target variable for the testing data. The accuracy_score function can be used to evaluate the accuracy of the predictions compared to the actual values.
The accuracy scores of the models can be compared to determine which model performs the best in predicting customer purchases based on gender and estimated salary.
This classification model can then be used to predict whether a new customer will make a purchase or not based on their gender and estimated salary.
