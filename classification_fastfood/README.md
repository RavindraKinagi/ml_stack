The problem statement of the project is to analyze the Fast Food Nutrition Dataset and provide insights and recommendations to help consumers make healthier choices at fast food restaurants. The dataset contains information on the nutritional content of various fast food products, including calories, fat, carbohydrates, protein, and other nutrients.
The project aims to achieve the following objectives:
1.	Analyze the average nutritional values per restaurant to identify which restaurants offer healthier options in terms of calories, fat, carbohydrates, and protein.
2.	Visualize the average nutritional values using bar plots to make it easier for consumers to compare different restaurants.
3.	Use a decision tree model to provide decision support for choosing a restaurant based on factors such as fat consumption, salt consumption, carbohydrate intake, and protein intake.
4.	Identify the top three items with the least calories and fat at each restaurant to help consumers make healthier choices at specific fast food chains.
5.	Determine which restaurants tend to offer healthier options overall based on the distribution of nutritional values.
6.	Differentiate between positive and negative nutrients and provide recommendations for a balanced diet at fast food restaurants.
By achieving these objectives, the project aims to empower consumers with information and insights to make informed decisions about their food choices at fast food restaurants.
