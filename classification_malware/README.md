It seems like you have written a script to perform classification tasks on a malware dataset. The script involves several steps such as data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).
The dataset you are using is called "ClaMP_Integrated-5184.csv" and it contains information about malware samples. You have imported the necessary libraries and loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Next, you performed some exploratory data analysis by checking the columns, data types, and missing values in the dataset. You also checked the distribution of the target variable (class) and visualized it using a bar plot.
After that, you preprocessed the data by converting the "packer_type" column into numeric values. Then, you split the dataset into training and testing sets.
You implemented SVM classifiers with different kernels (polynomial, sigmoid, and linear) using pipelines and performed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV. You evaluated the classifiers using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, you visualized the confusion matrix using a heatmap.
Finally, you implemented an ANN model using the Keras library. The model architecture consists of multiple dense layers with the ReLU activation function. You compiled the model with the binary cross-entropy loss function and the RMSprop optimizer. You trained the model on the training data and evaluated its performance on the validation data. You also visualized the changing loss and accuracy during training using helper functions.
Overall, it seems like you have successfully performed classification tasks on the malware dataset using SVM and ANN models.
