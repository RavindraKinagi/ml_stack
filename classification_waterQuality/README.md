The provided code performs the following steps for water quality analysis:
1.	Imports the necessary libraries, including numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
2.	Reads the water quality dataset from the CSV file.
3.	Performs data preprocessing steps such as checking data types, handling missing values, and converting data types.
4.	Conducts data analysis by visualizing different features and their relationships with the target variable (is_safe).
5.	Splits the dataset into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from sklearn.model_selection.
6.	Trains a Logistic Regression model on the training data and makes predictions on the testing data.
7.	Calculates the accuracy score of the Logistic Regression model.
8.	Trains a Linear Regression model on the training data and makes predictions on the testing data.
9.	Calculates the mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of the Linear Regression model.
