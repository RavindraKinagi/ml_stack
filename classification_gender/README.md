The dataset contains features such as forehead width and height, and the target variable is the gender. You have preprocessed the data by encoding the gender labels and scaling the features between 0 and 1.
You have defined a neural network model using TensorFlow's Keras API. The model consists of multiple dense layers with activation functions such as ReLU and a final output layer. The model has been compiled with the mean absolute error (MAE) loss function and the Adam optimizer.
You have trained the model using the training data and validated it using the validation data. The training process involved specifying the batch size, number of epochs, and evaluating the loss on both the training and validation sets. You have also generated predictions for a few examples from the validation set and compared them with the actual labels.
Finally, you have visualized the training and validation loss over epochs using a line plot.
