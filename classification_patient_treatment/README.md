The provided code performs the following tasks:
1.	It imports the necessary libraries and modules from scikit-learn and pandas.
2.	It reads the dataset from the file "data-ori.csv" using the pd.read_csv() function.
3.	It displays information about the dataset using the data.info() method, including the number of rows, columns, and data types.
4.	It counts the occurrences of each unique value in the 'SOURCE' column using the value_counts() method.
5.	It defines a function preprocess_inputs(df) for preprocessing the data, which includes binary encoding of the 'SEX' column (replacing 'F' with 0 and 'M' with 1), splitting the data into input features (X) and target variable (y), and performing train-test split and feature scaling using StandardScaler.
6.	It calls the preprocess_inputs() function to obtain the preprocessed training and testing data (X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test).
7.	It defines a dictionary models that contains various classification models from scikit-learn.
8.	It iterates over the models dictionary and trains each model using the training data (X_train, y_train), printing the name of the model when it is trained.
9.	It evaluates the trained models by predicting the target variable for the testing data (X_test) and calculating the accuracy using the accuracy_score() function. The results are printed for each model.
10.	It evaluates the trained models by calculating the F1-score using the f1_score() function, considering the positive label as 'in'. The results are printed for each model.
