A project to predict credit risk using data science and big data techniques. data preprocessing and feature engineering on the dataset. Here's a breakdown of the steps you've taken:
1.	Imported the necessary libraries for data analysis and visualization.
2.	Read the dataset using pandas and examined its structure and summary statistics.
3.	Explored the categorical features by checking unique values and visualizing their distributions.
4.	Visualized the class distribution for each categorical feature.
5.	Encoded the categorical features using label encoding.
6.	Explored the correlation between different dimensions using a correlation heatmap.
7.	Conducted feature engineering by creating new features based on existing ones.
8.	Divided the dataset into training and testing sets.
9.	Applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the class distribution in the training set.
10.	Applied feature scaling using StandardScaler.
11.	Evaluated various machine learning models on the dataset, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Neural Network, XGBoost, and Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier.
12.	Performed hyperparameter optimization using randomized search (Random Forest and Logistic Regression).
13.	Plotted the recall, accuracy, and precision for different probability thresholds for the Random Forest and Logistic Regression models.
 in the process of evaluating and fine-tuning the models to choose the best one for credit risk prediction.
