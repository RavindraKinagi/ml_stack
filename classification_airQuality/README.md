The objective of this code is to perform the following tasks:
1.	Load and analyze a dataset containing measurements of various features (MQ1, MQ2, MQ3, MQ4, MQ5, MQ6) and the corresponding CO2 levels.
2.	Preprocess the data by splitting it into training and testing sets, where 70% of the data is used for training and 30% for testing. The target variable (CO2) is separated from the features.
3.	Train a Random Forest Classifier model on the training data to predict CO2 levels based on the given features.
4.	Evaluate the accuracy of the trained model on the testing data and print the result.
5.	Utilize SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to determine the impact of each feature on the model's predictions and generate a summary plot.
The purpose of this code is to analyze the relationship between the input features and CO2 levels, build a predictive model using Random Forest Classifier, and interpret the model's feature importance using SHAP values. The overall aim is to understand the factors influencing CO2 levels and create a reliable model for CO2 prediction.
