The provided code performs the following steps:
1.	Imports the necessary libraries.
2.	Loads the wine quality data from a CSV file.
3.	Preprocesses the data by dropping rows with missing values and creating binary columns for wine type and wine quality.
4.	Splits the data into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function.
5.	Applies standard scaling to the features using the StandardScaler.
6.	Creates a basic neural network model using the Sequential API of Keras with two dense layers and a dropout layer.
7.	Compiles the model with binary cross-entropy loss, Adam optimizer, and accuracy metric.
8.	Fits the model to the training data, specifying the number of epochs and a learning rate scheduler as a callback.
9.	Plots the loss, accuracy, and learning rate over the epochs.
10.	Compiles the model again with a different learning rate value and metrics.
11.	Fits the optimized model to the training data for 100 epochs.
12.	Plots the loss and accuracy of the optimized model over the epochs.
binary classification problem where the goal is to predict whether a wine is of good quality or not. The code trains a neural network model on the wine quality data and evaluates its performance using loss and accuracy metrics.
