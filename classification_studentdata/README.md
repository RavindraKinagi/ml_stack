The problem statement in this analysis is to understand the relationship between various features in the dataset and their effect on students' grades. The dataset contains information about students in two schools, including attributes such as school, sex, age, address, family size, parents' education, parents' jobs, travel time, study time, failures, extra support, extracurricular activities, internet access, alcohol consumption, health status, absences, and the three periods' grades (G1, G2, G3).
The analysis consists of several steps:
1.	Data Acquisition: The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
2.	Data Cleansing: Missing values are checked, and it is found that there are no missing values in the dataset. Outliers are also examined using boxplots, and the outliers are removed from the dataset.
3.	Data Exploration: Descriptive statistics of the dataset are calculated, and the correlation between features is visualized using a heatmap.
4.	Data Analysis: Different aspects of the data are analyzed to understand their relationship with students' grades. This includes analyzing the impact of gender, age, cohabitation status of parents, travel time, parents' education, family relationships, health status, and previous grades on students' final grades.
5.	Data Visualization: Various bar plots and box plots are used to visualize the distribution and relationship of different features with students' grades.
The analysis answers several questions, such as the impact of gender, age, cohabitation status of parents, education of parents, study time, family relationships, health status, and previous grades on students' final grades.
