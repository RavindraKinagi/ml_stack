Based on the provided code, it appears that the problem statement is related to predicting energy efficiency based on a given set of features.
The code begins by importing necessary libraries such as numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, and seaborn. The dataset "energy_efficiency_data.csv" is read into a pandas DataFrame called df. Some exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the dataset.
Visualization techniques such as heatmaps, histograms, and pair plots are used to analyze the relationships and distributions of variables in the dataset. Correlation analysis is performed using a heatmap to identify the relationships between variables.
The dataset is split into features X and target variables y for further analysis. The dataset is then divided into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn.
The code proceeds to build and evaluate three regression models: Random Forest Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Linear Regression.
For each model, the necessary scikit-learn regressor is imported, and the model is trained on the training data using the fit function. Predictions are made on the test data using the predict function. Evaluation metrics such as mean squared error and root mean squared error are calculated to assess the performance of each model.
Additionally, cross-validation is performed using the cross_val_score function to evaluate the models' performance on different splits of the training data.
Finally, a dataframe called Acc is created to store the model names and their corresponding R-squared scores on the training and test data. The dataframe is sorted based on the test R-squared scores to compare the performance of different models.
In summary, the problem statement is to predict energy efficiency based on a given set of features. The code explores the dataset, builds and evaluates regression models including Random Forest Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Linear Regression. The performance of each model is assessed using evaluation metrics and cross-validation.
