classifying songs in terms of popularity on Spotify using a neural network. The code performs various steps, including data preprocessing, creating a dataset, defining data loaders, building and training a neural network model, and evaluating the model's performance.
Here's a breakdown of the code:
1.	Importing the necessary libraries: csv, torch, torch.nn, torch.optim, torch.nn.functional, torch.utils.data, torchvision, numpy, pandas, and matplotlib.pyplot.
2.	Reading the dataset from the file "Best Songs on Spotify from 2000-2023.csv" using pandas and storing it in two DataFrames: df and dft.
3.	Categorizing the "popularity" column into three bins: 0, 1, and 2 using the pd.cut function.
4.	Defining a function onehot_encode to perform one-hot encoding on the "artist" and "top genre" columns.
5.	Applying one-hot encoding on the "df" DataFrame for the "artist" and "top genre" columns using the onehot_encode function.
6.	Preparing the dataset for PyTorch by dropping unnecessary columns and converting the remaining data into tensors.
7.	Defining a custom dataset class CTDataset that inherits from the torch.utils.data.Dataset class. It takes the songs and popularity tensors as inputs and implements the required methods.
8.	Creating an instance of the CTDataset class called dataset using the song and target tensors.
9.	Splitting the dataset into train, validation, and test sets using the random_split function from PyTorch.
10.	Creating data loaders for the train, validation, and test sets using the DataLoader class.
11.	Defining the neural network model class NeuralNet that inherits from torch.nn.Module. It defines the layers of the network and the forward pass.
12.	Creating an instance of the NeuralNet class called model.
13.	Defining the loss function as cross-entropy loss and the optimizer as Adam.
14.	Moving the model to the GPU if available.
15.	Training the model using a loop over the epochs and batches. It performs forward and backward passes, updates the model parameters, and calculates the running loss.
16.	Evaluating the model on the validation set and calculating the accuracy.
17.	Evaluating the model on the test set (hold-out) and calculating the accuracy, precision, recall, and generating a classification report.
Overall, the code aims to train a neural network model on the Spotify songs dataset to classify songs into categories of popularity. It then evaluates the model's performance on the validation and test sets, providing accuracy, precision, recall, and a classification report.
